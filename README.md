# 👋 Assalamu 'Alaikum, I'm Shahriar Shahadat

🎓 A medical student with a passion for technology, automation, and meaningful software. (Currently, studying MBBS in Mymensingh Medical College)

💻 Though my background is in medicine, I’ve always been driven by curiosity to learn coding and build tools that help others — especially in the Islamic, productivity, and automation space.

- 🧠 Apply **AI APIs** to simplify tasks for individuals and small teams
- 🔧 Use Python, MoviePy, Pillow, Graph API, and other tools to create complete solutions

## 🌟 Highlights
